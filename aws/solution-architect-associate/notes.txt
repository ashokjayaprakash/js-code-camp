AWS

Region
------
 AZ - Availability Zones - Each region has many AZ's

AWS Services are Global / Region Scoped

IAM  - Identity and Access Management Global Service
---------------------------------------------------
User - Poeple in an organization
Group - Only contain users
 > Group can contains user from multiple group
Permissions - Access policy defines permission for user / group on what to do, Its configured as JSON
 > Ensure least privilige for user.

Setup Admin account via root user and use it further.

Role
----
The IAM Permission assigned to the service is Role.

MFA
---
1. Virtual MFA (Google Authenticator / Authy)
2. U2A (Universal 2nd Factor)
3. Hardware Key Fob MFA
4. AWS GovCloud

Ways to access AWS Services
1. Console
2. CLI
3. SDK

IAM Security Tools - Audit
------------------
Credential Report - Org level 
Access Advisor - User level access info 

IAM Best Practice
1. Assigne user -> group -> permission
2. one physical user = aws user
3. Never share credentials

EC2 - Elastic Compute Cloud

Security Group
Acts an firewall
> Regulate Ports
> Authorized IP Ranges
> Control or Inbound & Outbound
> Can be attached to Multiple Instances
> All inbound is blocked
> All outbound is authorized.
Any timeout issue is related to Security Group Issue

Important Ports
22 - SSH
21 - FTP
22 - SFTP
80 - HTTP
443 - HTTPS
3389 - RDP ( Specific for Windows)

EC2 Purchase Options
1. On-Demand - Short Time (Unpredictable Time)
	Linux - Pay per second
	Window - Pay per hour
2. Reserved Instances ( Huge Cost Saving by Discount)
	> Reserved Instances (Reserve the instase for 1 or 3 years by choosing instance type)
	> Covertible Reserved Instances - (Can change Ec2 instance type, less discount) 
	> Scheduled Reserved Instances - (Reserve by Timing)
3. Spot Instances
	> 90% Discount - Most cost efficient
	> Instance can loose at any point
	> Useful for workload that are resilent to failure
		> Batch Jobs
		> Image Processing
4. Dedicated Hosts ( Entire Physical Server
	> Address Compilance requirements / regulatory
	> Bring your own license
	> 3 year reservation
5. EC2 Dedicated Instance
	> Hardware dedicated to you.
	> May share hardware within the same account
IPv4 
----
Public Ip - Can be access across everywhere and its unique
Private Ip - Can be access inside a private network. In order to access the internet, Internet Gateway is required.
Elastic Ip - Reserved Public IP for an resource, the will not change when the resource is start / stop

EC2 Instance come with both private and public ip

Spot Instance 
	Create or Stop instance based on the bidding
	Termination: Instance should be in active, open & disable.
	Cancel Spot Request -> Terminate Instance
Spot Fleets
	A set of spot instances + On Demand (optional)
	Meet target capacity with price constaints
		> Possible Launch Pools
		> Can have multiple launch pools, so that fleet can choose
		> Stops launc when it reaches max cost or capacity
Strategy to Allocate Spot Fleet
	> lowestPrice - Cost Optimization - Short Workload
	> divirsifed - Avaliablity & long Workload
	> capacityOptimized - Pool with optimal capacity for no of instances
Spot fleet allow us to automatically reqest spot instances with low cost.

EC2 Placement Group - EC2 Hardware Placement
Type of Placement Group
1. Cluster - Placement group with low latency network, all instances in same rack, AZ
	Great Network
	If rack fails all instance fails
	UC: Big Data Job & App with low latency and high n/w throughput.
2. Spread - All EC2 instances in diff hardware and mutliple AZ
	> Reduce Risk
	> Limited to 7 instance per AZ per placement group
	> UC: High Availability Application
3. Partition - Instances are partitioned within the AZ and region
	> 7 Partitions pers AZ
	> Span across multiple AZ in same region
	> Up to 100 EC2s
	> Same instance rack is not shared with partitions
	> EC2 get access to partition info as metadata
	> UC: HBase, Cassandra, Kafka

ENI - Elastic Network Interface
-------------------------------
A logical componenet in VPC which represents the network card
ENI Attributes
	> Primary Private IPv4 and secondary
	> 1 Public IPv4
	> One or more SG
	> A MAc address
ENI Shall be created independently and attached to EC2
Bound to AZ

EC2 Hibernate - Persist the RAM state by storing it in EBS 
	> Supported Instances C/M/R (3-5)
	> RAM Size must be < 50GB
	> Not supported for Bare Metal
	> Root Volume must be EBS, encrypted
	> Avl on On-Demand & Reserved Instances
	> Hiberate cannot be more than 60 days.
EC2 Nitro
	> Avanced Virtualization Technology
	> Higher EBS IOPS Speed (64K IOPS Nitro, 32k IOPS NonNitro)
vCPU
	> A core is a CPU, core can contains multiple threads (Multithreading)
	> Core * Thread (1 Core * 2 Thread = 2vCPU)
	> Reduce cores for CPU Optimization
	> For HPC have one threads per core. Disable multi threading.

EBS - Elastic Block Store
-------------------------
	> Network Drive to store data via network
	> Available with in AZ
	> Have a provisioned capacity, can increase capacity
	> More than 1 EBS shall be attached to EC2 instances
	> EC2 Termination may delete the volume based on configuration
EBS Snapshot
------------
	> Backup of EBS volume
	> EBS Detach is not necessary for snapshot, but recomended
	> Can tranfered within AZ or Region
EBS Volume Types
	> General Purpose SSD (gp2/gp3) - Low latency interactive apps ( Dev/ Test env)
		> 1 GB - 16 TB
		> gp3 - Baseline 3000 IOPS & Throughput 125 MB. IOPS can increase upto 16k & Throughput 1000 MiB
		> gp2 - Small volumes can burst 3k IOPS, max 16k IOPS. 3IOPS per GiB
	> Provisioned IOPS (io1/io2) - High Performance Workload require millisecond latency
		> io1 - Max PIOPS: 64K - Nitro EC2; 32k for EC2 - Durable and more PIOPS per GB	
		> io2 Block Express (4-64 TiB) - Sub Milli second latency - Max PIOPS 256K IOPS with 1000 IOPS per GiB ratio
		> Support EBS Multi Attach
	> st1(HDD) - Low cost HDD volume designed for throughput intensive work load
		> Big Data Warehousing		
	> sc1(HDD) - Low cost designed for less frequent access work load
		> Archival - Cold Storage
Only gp2/3 - io1/2 shall be used as boot volume.
Multi Attach Supported only in (io1 & io2)
	> Same EBS shall be used by multiple EC2 instances in same AZ
	> UC: High application availability; Concurret application processing
	> Must use File system thats cluster aware
EBS Encryption
	> Data at rest is encrypted
	> Data in flight moving between instance is encrypted
	> All snapsots are encrypted & volumes
	> Encryption has minimal impact on latency
	> EBS Encryption leverages keys from KMS (AES-256)
	
EBS Characteristics
-------------------
IOPS - Number of read / write per second
Throughput - Rate of data transfer per second.
Size

AMI - Amazon Machine Image
--------------------------
AMI are customization of an EC2 Instance
Create your own AMI
AWS Market place - Community / Seller

Process
	Start EC2 -> Customize -> Stop -> Build AMI -> Use it across regions
EC2 Instance Store - Hardware disc attached to EC2. Special type of EC2 support Instance store
	> High Performance
	> Ephemreal Storage 
	> Good for buffer / cache / temporary data
	> Risk of data loss if hardware fails
	
EBS RAID - Redudant Array of Independent Disks
--------
	> OS Level Configuration
RAID 0 (Stripping)
	> Increased Performance but not fault tolerant
	> Mutlipe EBS as logical volume, if one volume fails all the data is lost
	> Huge Disc with high IOPS
	> Used for data replication or an app needs high IOPS
RAID 1 ( Mirroring - Increased Fault Tolerance)
	> Multiple EBS attached to EC2 and data is mirrored to both
	> Send data to 2 EBS is 2x network utilization

EFS Elastic File System
-----------------------
	> Network file system shall be mounted to many EC2's, available across region.
	> US: CMS, Data Sharing, Web Serving
	> LINUX based AMI Only
	> Use SG to controll access
	> POSIX File System
EFS - Performance
	> 1K Concurrent NFS Clients, 10 GB+ /s throughput
	> Grow to Pentabyte scale n/w File system
	> GP Mode- latency sensitive use cases (CMS)
	> MAX I/O Mode - High latency throughput, parallel processing - Big data / Media Processing
	> Provision your throughput regardless of size
	> Tiers - Standard / Infrequent Access (Cost for retrieval)
