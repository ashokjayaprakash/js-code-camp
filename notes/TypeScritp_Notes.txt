TypeScript (A statically typed superset of Javascript that compiles to plain Javascript)
------------------------------
Static Type - Bridges devloper (Code navigation)
V8 Runtime / Docker RunTime
Codeplex

VS Code (Devloped in TypeScript/ Runs on VM Electron Shell Webkit/Node/V8 Desktop Apps)

Adding Type 

Interface Declaration

Declaration File (Header File of Vs Code)

Type Information

tsc -init -> Intialize tsconfig.json
tsc -w -> watch mode

TS Compiler options to choose target.
Check Js

Real word usage of TS
-------------------------------------
AppScript intially planed by google then TS collabrated

Decorator

Vue.js

Non Nullable types Discrimated Unitons
Control flow analysis
@types Definition files

Nightly build (Virtual Cycle)

Control flow based type analysis

let count = 0;

OptionalParameter (?) 
Parameter can be null/string (string | null)[]

type - Defining a type

JS Type Checking (loadash)

Type Info by Type Provision.

Tuple/lookup/mapped types

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Basic Types
-> boolean
-> number
-> string
-> Array
	-> Element type number[]
	-> Generic type Array<number>
-> Tuple - Express an array where the type of a fixed number of elements.
	let x: [string, number];
	x = ["name", 10];
It will be an union type when elements accessed outside of its index.
	x[2] = string or number (Union Type)
-> enum
	enum Color {Red, Green, Blue}
	let c: Color = Color.Green;
-> any
	-> Type checking will not be performed.
	-> any , any[]
-> void
	function warnUser(): void {}
-> null and undefinded are types and also sub types of remaining
-> never - Returns the type of value which never occurs.

-> interface - Shape of the object
-> readonly - Not modifying object attributes

Subtype vs Assignment

> Symbols
To handle dynamic keys

for in - to iterate over the key 
for of - to iterate over the, only iteratable over array,map,set, string

Modules

Modules are executed within their own scope, not in global scope. Inorder to make it accessible, it needs to be exported and then imported.

Module loader - To load modules (CommonJs/RequireJS)
