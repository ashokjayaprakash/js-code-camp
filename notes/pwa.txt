To be considered a Progressive Web App, your app must be:

Progressive - Work for every user, regardless of browser choice, because they are built with progressive enhancement as a core tenet.

Responsive - Fit any form factor, desktop, mobile, tablet, or whatever is next.

Connectivity independent - Enhanced with service workers to work offline or on low quality networks.

App-like - Use the app-shell model to provide app-style navigation and interactions.

Fresh - Always up-to-date thanks to the service worker update process.

Safe - Served via HTTPS to prevent snooping and ensure content has not been tampered with.

Discoverable - Are identifiable as “applications” thanks to W3C manifests and service worker registration scope allowing search engines to find them.

Re-engageable - Make re-engagement easy through features like push notifications.

Installable - Allow users to “keep” apps they find most useful on their home screen without the hassle of an app store.

Linkable - Easily share via URL and not require complex installation.
